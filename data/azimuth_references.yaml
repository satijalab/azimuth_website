      This PBMC reference dataset was generated as part of the [Hao and Hao et al, bioRvix 2020](https://satijalab.org/v4preprint) paper. It is comprised of data from eight volunteers enrolled in an HIV vaccine trial from which three time point samples were taken at day 0, 3, and 7 following vaccination. All 24 samples were processed with a CITE-seq panel of 228 TotalSeq A antibodies to generate single-cell RNA and ADT data. The data were then integrated using metholody described in the pre-print linked above to generate a weighted nearest neighbor (WNN) representation of the RNA and protein data jointly. This WNN representation is used in the Azimuth app to assign celltypes, embed in the reference UMAP, and impute protein levels for the query dataset.

      This reference of human motor cortex was generated from data and annotations available from the Allen Institute. Originally described in [Bakken et al, bioRxiv 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.016972), this data was the integrated across the two individual donors to create the Azimuth reference used here. Annotations are provided at the level of _class_ (e.g. GABAergic), _subclass_ (e.g. L2/3 IT), _cluster_ (e.g. Inh L1-2 VIP WNT4), and _cross-species cluster_ (e.g. Sst_6).

      The data used in this reference was generated as part of the effort by [Yao, Liu, Xie, Fischer, et al, bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.970558v1) to generate an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the primary motor cortex in mouse. To generate the reference used in Azimuth, we applied a reference-based integration strategy to harmonize the 10x v3 snRNA-seq data across 12 individual mice. Annotations are provided at the level of _class_ (e.g. GABAergic), _subclass_ (e.g. L2/3 IT), _cluster_ (e.g. L2/3 IT_3), and _cross-species cluster_ (e.g. Sst_6)
